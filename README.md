# Unrar-Scene-Tv-Series

Small script I use that will unrar complete tv series.
 - The first /* is for the seasons.
 - The second /* is for the episodes.
 - The third /* is for the .rar files.
 - My directories always look like this /Tv Series Name/Season/Episode/Rar files 
 - So adjust the /* according to your directories.
